# NOTE: This is a custom build of Friday Night Funkin' that adds custom characters! You're likely looking for the original repository, found right [here!](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin)

This is a custom build of Friday Night Funkin' which adds a Guncannon in place of the boyfriend. There are currently files for a Gundam spritesheet for Pico, but it is unimplemented and will likely remain that way until I figure out how to do a few other things, including custom songs for the Guncannon, a way to allow the player to switch between Guncannon and BF, and so on.
